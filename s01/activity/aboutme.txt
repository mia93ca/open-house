I joined the open house to get a feel for what coding is about. I also wanted to know what the classes are like and if I can do the tasks or activities that are required.

My work experience is mainly in Accounting. I worked as an accountant for almost 9 years and then I searched for remote work. For the past 5 years, I have been working as an Amazon Virtual Assistant.
